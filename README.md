# follower-bot-373-project

The project was made using two robots we made. We used the Zumo platform along with F411-RE Nucleo boards for each.
One was a leader controlled by us using a Nintendo 64 controller, with a special purpose unit made of an array of LEDs connected to an Arduino Uno on top to blink certain patterns for certain directions.
The follower bot was semi autonomous and used a PixyCam to detect the patterns blinked to follow the leader and maintained stability and direction using an ultrasonic sensor and PID control.
Obviously this is not all of the code as all the preprocessor and pre-generated files were too large, and I felt pointless to push.
Would be happy to talk more about this and help if anyone reaches out though.

Thanks!
